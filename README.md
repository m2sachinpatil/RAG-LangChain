# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with LangChain

## Introduction
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a powerful framework that combines information retrieval and text generation techniques to enhance natural language understanding and generation tasks. This README provides an overview of using RAG with LangChain, a versatile tool for handling prompts and context in natural language processing tasks.

## Features
- Seamless integration of LangChain with RAG for handling prompts and context.
- Enhanced natural language understanding and generation through the retrieval augmented generation framework.
- Efficient processing of large text inputs using LangChain's capabilities for managing context and prompts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- LangChain library
- RAG framework

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x on your system if you haven't already.
2. Install the LangChain library using pip:
    ```
    pip install langchain
    ```
3. Install the RAG framework following the instructions provided in the RAG documentation.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
    ```python
    import langchain
    from rag import RAGModel
    ```
2. Initialize the LangChain context manager:
    ```python
    context_manager = langchain.ContextManager()
    ```
3. Create prompts and context using LangChain:
    ```python
    prompt = context_manager.create_prompt("Your prompt goes here.")
    context = context_manager.create_context("Your context goes here.")
    ```
4. Initialize the RAGModel with LangChain context:
    ```python
    rag_model = RAGModel(context=context)
    ```
5. Use the RAGModel to generate responses or perform natural language understanding tasks:
    ```python
    response = rag_model.generate_response(prompt)
    ```

## Examples
```python
import langchain
from rag import RAGModel

# Initialize LangChain context manager
context_manager = langchain.ContextManager()

# Create prompt and context
prompt = context_manager.create_prompt("Can you tell me about India's diverse landscapes?")
context = context_manager.create_context("India, often referred to as the jewel of the East, is a land of remarkable diversity...")

# Initialize RAGModel with LangChain context
rag_model = RAGModel(context=context)

# Generate response using RAGModel
response = rag_model.generate_response(prompt)
print(response)
