    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines two fundamental approaches in natural language processing: generation and retrieval. Here's how it typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Component**: The system has access to a database or a large repository of structured or unstructured data. This database contains information relevant to the task at hand, such as facts, knowledge, or contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Process**: When presented with a query or prompt, the system first retrieves relevant information from the database using retrieval techniques. This retrieval can involve various methods such as keyword matching, semantic similarity, or more advanced algorithms like dense retrieval using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generation Component**: After retrieving relevant information, the system then utilizes a generative language model (such as GPT) to generate a response or complete the task. This generative component is responsible for producing natural language text based on the input query and retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration**: The retrieved information is integrated into the generation process, influencing the content and structure of the generated response. This integration can occur at different levels, from simple concatenation of retrieved passages to more sophisticated methods that selectively incorporate relevant information while generating the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output**: The final output is a response that combines both generated text and retrieved information, tailored to address the input query or task. The integration of retrieval and generation allows the system to leverage external knowledge sources to produce more accurate, coherent, and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, RAG models enable more informed and contextually rich interactions by leveraging both generative capabilities and access to external knowledge sources. They are particularly useful in tasks that require access to domain-specific knowledge or where context plays a crucial role in generating accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by initializing the environment variables required for use."
